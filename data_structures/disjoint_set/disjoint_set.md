# Disjoint_set

The **disjoint-set data structure (union-find structure)** keeps track of sets that are partitioned into non-overlapping subsets. This disjoint-set structure can be implemented using:

- Arrays
- Trees

Two sets are disjoint when they have no elements in common. In other words, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is an empty set.

For example, the `{1,3,5}` and `{2,4,6}` sets are disjoint because they have no common elements.

## Hash function  
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

1. Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.

2. Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

3. Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.

>**Note**: Irrespective of how good a hash function is, collisions are bound to occur. Therefore, to maintain the performance of a hash table, it is important to manage collisions through various collision resolution techniques.
